In this workshop, you review [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)  design patterns and best practices to build highly scalable applications that are optimized for performance and cost. This workshop implements these design patterns by using Python scripts. At the end of this workshop, you will have the knowledge to build and monitor DynamoDB applications that can grow to any size and scale.

Here's what this workshop includes:

- Start here: Getting Started
- Exercise 1: DynamoDB Capacity Units and Partitioning
- Exercise 2: Sequential and Parallel Table Scans
- Exercise 3: Global Secondary Index Write Sharding
- Exercise 4: Global Secondary Index Key Overloading
- Exercise 5: Sparse Global Secondary Indexes
- Exercise 6: Composite Keys
- Exercise 7: Adjacency Lists
- Exercise 8: Amazon DynamoDB Streams and AWS Lambda
