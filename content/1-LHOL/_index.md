In this workshop, you will learn to create and work with [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html).

Here's what this workshop includes:

- 1. Getting Started
- 2. Explore DynamoDB with the CLI
- 3. Explore the DynamoDB Console
- 4. Backups
- 5. LMIG: Relational Modeling & Migration

#### **Target audience**

This workshop is designed for developers, engineers, and database administrators who are involved in designing and maintaining DynamoDB applications.

#### **Requirements**
##### **Basic knowledge of AWS services**
- Among other services this lab will guide you through the use of [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

##### **Basic understanding of DynamoDB**
- If you're not familiar with DynamoDB or are not participating in this lab as part of an AWS event, consider reviewing the documentation on "[What is Amazon DynamoDB?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)"

##### **Recommended study before taking the lab**

If you're not part of an AWS event and you haven't recently reviewed DynamoDB design concepts, we suggest you watch this video on [Advanced Design Patterns for DynamoDB](:param{key="latest_rh_design_pattern_yt"}), which is about an hour in duration.
